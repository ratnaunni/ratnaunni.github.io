            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>CU Abhinaya is the University of Colorado Boulder’s premier Indian classical dance team, dedicated to
                sharing the elegance, storytelling, and cultural richness of South Asian traditions. Rooted in classical
                styles such as Bharatanatyam, Kathak, and Kuchupudi, our performances honor centuries of artistry while
                also embracing the creativity of contemporary movement. By blending tradition with new music, we bring a
                modern twist to classical dance that resonates with both South Asian communities and wider audiences.
                Our team performs at a variety of cultural showcases and community events throughout CU Boulder and the
                greater Denver area. Each performance is an opportunity to foster cultural appreciation, create
                connections, and share the joy of dance with diverse audiences.
                More than just a performance group, CU Abhinaya is a community. We are committed to providing students
                of all backgrounds an inclusive space to explore Indian classical dance, grow as artists, and build
                lasting friendships. Whether through high-energy group numbers, expressive solos, or collaborative
                events, we aim to highlight the power of dance as both an art form and a cultural bridge.</p>
